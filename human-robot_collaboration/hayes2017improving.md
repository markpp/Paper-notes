### Implementation


### What
- As controllers for robots becomes increasingly complex because of e.g. the use of machine learning they also become increasingly incomprehensible to the user
- Since mutual understanding is critical to effective collaboration this is a problem
- This work presents a number of algorithms and systems for robots to synthesise policy descriptions and for responding to human collaborators
- This is demonstrated to work with controllers based on conditional logic, tabular reinforcement learning and deep reinforcement learning
