- Goes into great detail with ideas and survey wrt. coordination, communication, planning, ml

### What
- robots are gradually leaving highly structured factory environments and moving into
human populated environments, requiring complex cognitive abilities. Where they also have to operate efficiently and safely, while also achieving higher levels of cooperation and communication.
- Defines collaboration as working with someone on something, aiming to reach a common goal. Humans and robots collaborating on a common task form a team. A team is a small number of partners with complementary skills who are committed to a common purpose, performance goal, and approach for which they hold themselves mutually accountable.
- Efficient collaboration requires a common plan for all involved partners. To gain a joint intention they need to know the intentions of the other team members and what they are doing. Based on that knowledge a robot can plan its own actions that will eventually lead to fulfil the joint intention and reach a common goal. Therefore, they need the abilities of perceiving and comprehending their environment, decision making, planning, learning, and reflection.
- New and unforeseen situation will often arise in HRC, which could not be foreseen by the programmer.
