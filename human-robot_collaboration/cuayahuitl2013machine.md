### What
- Goes through all of the types of feedback and learning techniques that can be used for machine learning with interactive systems and robots.
- Feedback can be anything from Evaluation: good/bad, numerical rewards to Correction: annotations, correct answer, demonstrations
- techniques are everything from unsupervised to supervised and applications such as transfer learning, active learning, social learning strategies
- Online learning is mentioned briefly
