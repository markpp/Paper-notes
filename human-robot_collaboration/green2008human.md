# Human-robot collaboration: A literature review and augmented reality approach in design


### What
- Starts with looking at Human-Human collaboration
- Touches on our use of non-verbal cues such as gesturing and gaze
- Some speech can only be understood when co-occuring with e.g. a gesture
- Understanding the environment/scene/context and using it a reference for communication
- A collaborative human-robot system has been shown to improve performance over either human or robot working alone.
- Robots have been used for hazardous tasks. Radioactive waste(teleoperation), search and rescue
- Adjustable autonomy is essential for effective collaboration
- Situational awareness is essential for effective collaboration
- The human coworker must know what is going on in the robot's world to avoid problems

- The value of AR, promises "seemless" interaction between real and virtual world, enhances reality, enable shared views, provide visual cues. Lets a person see what a robot sees.
- AR technology can be used to display visual cues that can increase situational awareness and improve the grounding process, enabling the human to more effectively understand what the robot is doing and its internal state (Collett and MacDonald 2006), thus supporting natural spatial dialogue.
- Two important concepts must be kept in mind when designing an effective human-robot collaboration system. One, the robotic system must be able to provide feedback as to its understanding of the situation and its actions (Scholtz 2002). Two, an effective human-robot system must provide mechanisms to enable the human and the robotic system to communicate effectively (Fong, Kunz et al. 2006).
- There are 3 communication channels: audio, environment, visual
- AR is an optimal method for conveying information. it is more intuitive. Using AR to display information, such as robot state, progress and even intent, will result in increased understanding, grounding and, therefore, enhanced collaboration.
- a robot should able to work autonomously, while retaining the ability to request assistance when guidance is needed or warranted.
- robot will be better understood and accepted if its communication behaviour more explicitly emulates that of a human.
- AR is ideal for collaboration with multiple humans and robots
