[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05548)

### Implementation
[SDK](https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-realsense-sdk)


### What
- Overview of Intel RealSense RGB-D imaging systems(R200 and RS400)
  - Mode-of-operation
  - Functional behavior
  - Expected performance
  - Shortcomings and limitations
  - Optics
  - Correlation algorithms

### How
- Use of active texture projector, which allows for depth generation for uniform surfaces
-

### Experiments
- The correlation algorithm does very well on the Middlebury stereo benchmark
