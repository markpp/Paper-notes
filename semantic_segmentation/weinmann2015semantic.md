# Semantic point cloud interpretation based on optimal neighborhoods, relevant features and efficient classifiers

### Implementation

### What
- The paper is based on much of Weinmann's earlier work e.g. (Distinctive 2D and 3D features for automated large-scale scene analysis in urban areas, 2015)
- A general framework for 3D scene analysis is proposed, it includes:
    - optimal neighborhood selection
    - extraction of low-level 3D and 2D features
    - various feature selection strategies
    - efficient supervised classifiers
- Selection of neighbourhood is strongly interleaved with feature extraction.
- The most common neighbourhood definitions are:
    - spherical neighbourhood, points inside a fixed radius
    - cylindrical neighbourhood, points who's 2D projection falls inside a circle with fixed radius
    - N-nearest neighbourhood, the N closest neighbours
