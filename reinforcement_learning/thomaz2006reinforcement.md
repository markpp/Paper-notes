Reinforcement learning with human teachers: Understanding how people want to teach robots

### Implementation

### What
- Robots need to be able to learn new skills by interacting with users
- Human guided RL for a cooking tasks
- Two types of feedback, the standard post action rewards and propose future directed rewards in the form of action guidance
- Important to understand the human-teach/robot-learner system
- Support how do people want to teach robots and figure out how to use that to improve performance
- Challenges with real-time learning in real environments, partial observability, dynamic, continuous, human patience, ambiguous human input
- Advocates the integration of machine learning into a human-robot interaction framework
- Guidance creates a significantly faster and more efficient learning and exploration interaction
- Dimensions of human-trainable systems: implicit(model or monitoring human activities) vs explicit training(active interaction).
- Dimensions of explicit training: does the human or the machine lead the interaction e.i. learning with queries and active learning(what does the machine want to know) vs human centred interaction ruled by how/what humans want to teach(future directed guidance as show in the this paper)
- Dimensions for exploration: human guidance vs self-exploration. This work created a learning system that can slide along the exploration-guidance spectrum
- A human teach can contribute with a forward looking feedback that is distinct from other forms of feedback
