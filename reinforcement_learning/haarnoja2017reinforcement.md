### Implementation

### What

- Proposes so called soft Q-learning which help explore more solutions, making the trained policy more robust to changes and avoiding local optimums
-
### How
- The maximum entropy formulation encourages the agent to try all possible solutions and explore a large portion of the state space.

### Experiments
-
