[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03940)

### Implementation

### What

- detects objects using template matching with non-maximum suppression based on scores. the 3D pose of individual objects is computed using ...
This approach is only appropriate for objects with well known and consistent shapes.
### How
