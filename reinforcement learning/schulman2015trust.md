### Implementation

### What
- Similar to adding a constraint to the updating to the policy, a penalty is added.
- Secures that updates to the policy does not move too far away from the starting point using KL-divergence for looking at the distribution of parameter vector.
- Probably first with RL for robotic locomotion
### How
