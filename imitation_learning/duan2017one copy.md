### Implementation

### What
- Imitation learning has been commonly applied to solve different tasks in isolation. This usually requires either careful feature engineering, or a significant number of samples.
- Ideally, robots should be able to learn from very few demonstrations of any given task, and instantly generalize to new situations of the same task, without requiring task-specific engineering
- They propose a meta-learning framework for achieving such capability, which they call one-shot imitation learning
