### Implementation

### What

- Uses HER and demonstrations(behaviour cloning)
- Demonstrations are not perfect and are done using VR
- Task is stacking of blocks, which has a relatively sparse reward. Configurable by the number of blocks
- Using BC at every step through out training is important, not just for initialisation
- Performance drops significantly at 4 blocks

### How
-

### Experiments
- Combination beats both HER or BC
