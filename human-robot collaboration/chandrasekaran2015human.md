### What
- effective HRC requires that the robot is able to understand information from several communication mechanisms
- The robots must learn during interaction, similar to how humans learns from observing and interacting, building a conceptual understanding of what was trained.
- Working in a close collaboration, not just cooperation, requires a seamless understanding between the actors and high level cognition capabilities.
