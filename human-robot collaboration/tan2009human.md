### What
- Praises the idea of cell production which is a dream combination of human flexibility and machine efficiency. It has the potential for addressing the rapid changes in requirement, short cycles that is modern manufacturing
- They define a production cell as a production unit with one of a small team of workers that multiple tasks in order to finish a product.
- They use something called a HTA model for breaking down a production cooperation
- Presents five safety designs covering both hardware and control. 1) human area and robot area, 2) Speed restricted zones, 3) same, 4) Vision system for monitoring the human operator, 5) Operational sequence safety control
