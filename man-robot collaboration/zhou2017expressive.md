# Game-theoretic modeling of human adaptation in human-robot collaboration

##


### Implementation


### What
- Humans often start with an inaccurate model of the robot capabilities.
- They gradually infer the actual capabilities of the robot as they interact with it
- The authors present a game-theoretic model of human partial adaptation to the robot, where the human responds to the robotâ€™s actions by maximizing a reward function
- The robot can use this model to decide optimally between taking actions that reveal its capabilities to the human and taking the best action given the information that the human currently has.
- The authors prove that under certain observability assumptions, the optimal pol- icy can be computed efficiently.
- They demonstrate through a human subject experiment that the proposed model significantly improves human-robot team performance, compared to policies that assume complete adaptation of the human to the robot.
- It is important that the human has a correct perception of what the robot's capabilities are
- This is often not the case because of pop culture and inexperience with working with real robots

### How
-

### Experiments
- collaboration is tested in a table clearing case
- Team performance is evaluated using the accumulated reward over 3 rounds
