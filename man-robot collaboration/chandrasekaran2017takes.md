# It Takes Two to Tango: Towards Theory of AI's Mind
[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00717)

### Implementation
[online test system](https://deshraj.github.io/TOAIM/)

### What
- The development of a theory of the AI's mind is necessary for succesful human-robot collaboration.
### How
- 
### Experiments
- 

1. Overall rating of the paper
Accept/Weak accept/Borderline/Weak reject/Reject
         
2. Summary of the paper (2-3 sentences)
The authors investigate humans' ability to develop a theory of the AI's mind and use this mental model to predict whether the AI will fail a given visual question answering task as well as predict what the AI will answer. They show that people can be improve their theory of the AI's mind by training on 50 examples beforehand and that giving the human insight into the internal state of the AI didn't improve the theory of mind.

3. Main strengths of the paper (item list)
- The idea is overall very easy to understand.
- Exceptionally extensive use of references.
- Interesting finding, namely that the tested insights to the state of the AI potentially doesn't help human understanding of AI behaviour.

4. Main weaknesses of the paper (item list)
- Lacks experiments with tasks outside of VQA domain.
        
5. Detailed comments (errors, missing references, suggestions for improvement, etc.)
It could be more clear what the training phase(instant feedback of IF) intails and how it differs from the following tests.

6. Organization, clarity, language/grammar
Great organization and clarity. Language is fine with a few formulation that could be better.
